# external-messaging-example
Example to demonstrate messaging between two chrome extensions

This example uses `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal` to pass two
integers a and b from the master extension to the slave extension. The slave will calculate the sum
and pass the result back to the master.

### Running the example

To run the example go to the *Chrome extensions page, activate the developer mode and load both the
slave and master directories as unpacked extensions.

When inspecting the background pages you will see the communication between the two extensions in
the console.

### Note

For simplicity both manifest files contain a key entry, this ensures that the unpacked extensions
will have the consistent ids. In a production environment the ids will of course be generated by
the chrome store and the key entries are not required.
